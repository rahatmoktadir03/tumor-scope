ðŸ§  TumorScope â€“ Brain Tumor Classification with Deep Learning & Gemini AI

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
TumorScope is a Streamlit-based web app that classifies brain MRI scans into four categories:
Glioma
Meningioma
Pituitary Tumor
No Tumor

It uses:
âœ… Xception (Transfer Learning)
âœ… Custom CNN model
âœ… Saliency Maps for Explainability
âœ… Gemini 1.5 Flash for Medical Explanation

âœ… Features
âœ” Upload Brain MRI images for instant classification
âœ” Two Models to Choose From: Transfer Learning & Custom CNN
âœ” Saliency Maps to visualize important brain regions
âœ” AI-Powered Explanation using Gemini 1.5 Flash
âœ” Interactive Probability Charts
âœ” Deployed on Streamlit Cloud
